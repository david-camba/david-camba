# Engineer, Builder, Extreme Learner.

I'm a Telecommunications Engineer (ECE equivalent). For love, I spent a few years in Mexico running a business outside of tech. Now, I'm returning to my core passion: software engineering.

To re-enter the field and master the modern software landscape, I've dedicated the last three months to a deep dive into first principles. My approach was simple: **instead of just learning frameworks, I rebuilt them from the ground up.**

My public repositories are each an exercise on a fundamental area of software:

*   🏛️ **`LifeTree` & `nTier`**: **Mastering Full-Stack Architecture.** A deep dive into modern software design, rebuilding and innovating on the foundational concepts that underpin both frontend and backend systems.
*   ⚡ **`JSEngine-Simulator`**: **Mastering Concurrency & Systems Programming.** A C++ model of the JS runtime, built to master the low-level fundamentals of multi-threading and memory management.
*   📡 **`Kafky-Event-Driven-Chat`**: **Mastering Distributed Systems.** An exploration that evolved from websockets into a full microservices architecture simulation using Event Sourcing & CQRS.

After building this foundation, I'm now looking to apply my skills to real-world challenges and grow under the guidance of great technical leaders.
