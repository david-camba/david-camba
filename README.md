# Engineer, Builder, Extreme Learner.

I'm a Telecommunications Engineer (ECE equivalent). For love, I spent a few years in Mexico running a business outside of tech. Now, I'm returning to my core passion: software engineering.

To re-enter the field and master the modern software landscape, I've dedicated the last three months to a deep dive into first principles. My approach was simple: **instead of just learning frameworks, I rebuilt them from the ground up.**

My public repositories are each an exercise on a fundamental area of software:

*   🏛️ **Mastering Backend Architecture:** [`nTier`](https://github.com/david-camba/nTier)
    *   A complete backend framework built on a hybrid layer architecture. A deep dive into Dependency Injection, testing, and the pragmatism behind SOLID to create a maintainable and scalable system.
*   🚀 **Mastering Frontend Systems Design:** [`LifeTree`](https://github.com/david-camba/LifeTree)
    *   A complete frontend framework with its own opinionated composition model, born from a personal challenge to deconstruct frontend 'magic'. A trial-by-fire that cemented my confidence in architecting complex systems from scratch.
*   ⚡ **Mastering Concurrency & Systems Programming:** [`JSEngine-Simulator`](https://github.com/david-camba/JSEngine-Simulator)
    *   A C++ model of the JS runtime, built to master the low-level fundamentals of multi-threading and memory management.
*   📡 **Mastering Distributed Systems:** [`kafky-event-driven-chat`](https://github.com/david-camba/kafky-event-driven-chat)
    *   An exploration that evolved from websockets into a full microservices architecture simulation using Event Sourcing & CQRS.

After building this foundation, I'm now looking to apply my skills to real-world challenges and grow under the guidance of great technical leaders.
